        Dylan Mills is a freshman at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology. He is interested in combing his technical and creative skills to make an impact on the world around him. However, he wasn’t always focused on technology. 
Dylan grew up as a competitive gymnast, competing for thirteen years and winning plenty of hardware to show for it, including five state championship all-around titles, two regional championship all-around titles, and an eastern national championship all-around title. Along with his passion for gymnastics, Dylan fell into musical theater and found it just as rewarding. Since finding the performing arts, he’s performed on stages in New York City and Boston, won acting and choreography awards, and performed in front of thousands of people.  Academically, Dylan has been honored with receiving outstanding achievement in a variety of high school classes, as well as membership into National Honors Society and The Society of National High School Honors, and more recently, named a Syracuse Leadership Scholar and Success Scholar. 
Although awards and recognitions are nice, it is the skills Dylan has gained to receive them that he values more. Through gymnastics, Dylan has developed his strong work ethic, attention to detail, and self-awareness. Through the arts, he has strengthened his creative, teamwork, and public speaking skills. And academically, he has become a master of time management, multihyphenate, and a leader.
Without these personal experiences, Dylan would not be the person he is today. Today, he also enjoys travelling, taking part in outdoor activities, and playing board games with his overly competitive family. 
For the future, Dylan hopes to build a career around creative technology and continue to perform across the country.
